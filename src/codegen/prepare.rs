//! Compiling an arbitrary SQL string, whatever kind of statement it is.
//!
//! [`compile_statement`](crate::codegen::compile_statement) covers write
//! and DDL statements only — hand it a `SELECT` and it answers
//! `DispatchError::Unrecognized("SELECT")`. A `SELECT` needs its `FROM`
//! tables resolved, its CTEs and views expanded, and `sqlite_stat1`
//! statistics loaded before it can be compiled at all, and the pipeline
//! that does that lived in `src/bin/sqlite-rs/query.rs` — inside the
//! executable, where no library consumer could reach it.
//!
//! That split is a CLI implementation detail, not something a consumer
//! should have to know. Stock SQLite has exactly one
//! `sqlite3_prepare_v2()`: you hand it any statement and get a handle
//! back. Spec 013's `Connection::prepare` has to behave the same way, so
//! the `SELECT` half moves here where both the CLI and the embedding API
//! can call it (013/Req 3, #695).
//!
//! Errors are [`CodegenError`]/[`PrepareError`] rather than the `String`
//! the CLI copy produced. Flattening a structured error into a message is
//! fine when the next step is printing it to a terminal; a library
//! consumer needs to match on what went wrong.
